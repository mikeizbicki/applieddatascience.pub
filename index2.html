<h1>Gender and Racial Bias Observed in the Popular fashion144k and fashion550k Datasets</h1>
<p>
<strong>tl;dr</strong>
The fashion144k and fashion550k datasets are the primary public datasets used for applying machine 
learning to fashion, and these datasets have been instrumental in the development of essentially all 
existing fashion tools. Using facial recognition algorithms, I show for the first time that both of these 
datasets are strongly biased towards white women in composition, and thus all existing fashion tools which depend 
on these datasets, essentially all existing fashion tools, are biased against men and non-white minorities. I show also
that the fashion rankings assigned to the fashion144k dataset are biased against non-white men. 
</p>

<dt-byline></dt-byline>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The <a href='https://esslab.jp/~ess/en/data/fashion144k/'>fashion144k dataset</a> 
is comprised of more than 144 thousand user images 
and is widely used in academic and personal research 
<dt-cite key='SimoSerraCVPR2015'></dt-cite>. 
The <a href='https://esslab.jp/~ess/en/data/fashion550k/'>fashion550k dataset</a>
is a similar but larger dataset which is comprised of around 550 thousand user 
images <dt-cite key='InoueICCVW2017'></dt-cite>. The goal of this project was to determine the racial and gender 
composition of the fashion550k dataset <dt-fn>This project was born from my interest in exploring the racial bias present
in the fashion industry through the racial composition of the people in promotional images on various United States 
clothing retailers. I intended to use website scraping software to pull all images present on retailers websites and 
run the face_classification project mentioned later on these images to determine whether brands are hiring a number of 
clothing models of each race proportional to the number of images containing models of that race. I was also interested to
see if various brands' claims to diversity hold up. Though this did not ultimitaly end up possible, based on the direction 
this project has taken I am interested to attempt to train computational models on images from retail websites to determine 
what racial and fashion biases they emerge with. I hypothesize that a narrow presence of models of color on retail sites
leads fashion algorithms to punitively score diversity and perpetuates the lack of diversity present on clothing retail sites</dt-fn>.
</p>
<p>
At the outset of this project I already had access to the complete datasets
through this course. In the case of the fashion144k dataset this consisted of images and associated metadata 
<dt-fn>fashion144k metadata consists of the photos themselves, location data for where the image was taken, and a fashionability 
score assigned to each image by the original creators of the dataset. In this project I use the images and their associated
fashionability score.</dt-fn> while the fashion550k dataset was comprised only of images. 
In order to accomplish the goal being able to both understand and to visualize
the composition of fashion550k, I ran multiple facial and attribute recognition 
libraries on the images in the dataset and I applied several facial recognition 
solutions to analyze this dataset including the python projects
<a href='https://face-recognition.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html'>face_recognition</a><dt-cite key='geitegey2018facerecognition'></dt-cite>
and <a href='https://github.com/wondonghyeon/face-classification'>face-classification</a><dt-cite key='won2018faceclassification'></dt-cite>
<dt-fn>Each of these projects consists of a pretrained model and a number of functions which may be called on new images.
The face_recognition model was build using dlib, and the face_classification model was trained on the LFWA+ dataset. 
face_recognition has a 99.38% accuracy in differentiating faces in the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset, a dataset generally
used as a benchmark in facial recognition libraries.</dt-fn>. 
These techniques assisted in reaching several conclusions, including: 
<a href=#data>racial bias in composition across gender</a>, 
<a href=#fashionabilitycorrellation>racial bias in assigned fashion score across gender</a>, and 
<a href=#modelerrorestimation>racial bias in locating faces</a>. 
Elaborations on each of these conclusions and the associated analysis may be found later in this article, 
though technical breakdowns will be saved largely for the footnotes.
</p>
<p>
Recognizing that the models which I am employing make broad generalizations 
surrounding race and gender, I will be referring to faces which this model 
assigns a specific attribute to as having an encoding of that attribute, ie. 
a face which this model classifies as male and white will be referred to as a 
white male encoding. I will refer to general faces as encodings.
</p>

<a name=data></a>
<h2>The Data</h2>
<p>
I modified the existing pred.py gender and race prediction file withing face_classification to return information matching 
an image file to the facial encodings found in it, to the predicted gender and race, to image files containing
matching encodings, as well as counts of all unique facial encodings found of each gender, race pair. 
I used the matplotlib python library to visualize the data returned by running this program on subsets of 
both the fashion144k and fashion550k datasets. In the plots below, we see the composition of both fashion144k and fashion550k 
compared to real world data<dt-cite key='uscensus'></dt-cite>. 
</p>
<img class=l-body src=img/figure_1.png>
<p>
We see on the Y axis three different datasets, the world population, fashion144k, 
and fashion550k, each broken up into the Male and Female categorites. On the X axis we see 
the Fraction of the Dataset made up by each of these categories. From this plot we are easily able to discern that 
in both fashion144k and fashion550k, female encodings found in images appear disproportionately often compared to
male encodings when compared with real world percentages<dt-fn>I note here that the United States Census data shown in 
each graph in this section is not indicative of the worldwide racial balance. The data used should be considered a placeholder
to offer some sense of scale. The fashion144k and fashion550k datasets are both composed of images from around the globe.</dt-fn>.
</p>
<img class=l-body src=img/figure_2.png>
<p>
In the above graph, on the Y axis we see the same three datasets, each broken up into the the three 
races which face_classification is able to identify. 
On the X axis we see the Fraction of Male Encodings in each dataset made up by each of these categories. We see that 
white men are overrepresented in both fashion144k and fashion550k compared to US Census data, and that black men are 
underrepresented.
</p>
<img class=l-body src=img/figure_3.png>
<p>
The above graph is identical in composition to the previous graph except that the X axis show the Fraction of 
Female Encodings made up by each racial category. We see the same patterns discussed above in the makeup of Female encodings, 
with the underrepresentation of black women in both fashion144k and fashion550k even more pronounced.
</p>
<p>
We see that encodings of women appear most often in images in  this dataset, with over 90% of encodings 
found in a 50% sampling of Fashion144k<dt-fn>About 72,000 images.</dt-fn> and over 90% of encodings found in a 30% sampling 
of Fashion550k<dt-fn>About 150,000 images.</dt-fn> classified as women. We see that in both datasets, 
white women make up over 70% of this majority. 
It is also interesting to note that while the racial imbalance seen in Male encodings and in Female encodings
trend the same way, the ratio of racial encodings within the two genders is quite different in both fashion144k 
and fashion550k.
</p>

<h3>Fashion Score Correllation</h3>
<p>
As previously stated, the fashion144k dataset has fashionability scores associated with each image. Using face_recognition 
and face_classification I was able to match each image to an associated gender, race, and fashionability score.
</p>
<img class=l-body src=img/figure_6.png>
<p>
The above details the spread of fashionability scores by gender and race. Looking at the X axis which indicates a fashionability score
between 1 and 10, we are able to see that while the spreads are different,
the median fashionability score for all female encodings and white male encodings occur in the same general area. 
However, the median fashionability score for black men and asian men is considerably lower. In particular, the spread for 
images with asian male encodings is particularly low on the scale.
</p>

<a name=modelerrorestimation></a>
<h3>Model Error Estimation</h3>
<p>
In using a pretrained model, it was imperative to have some method of estimating the error expected from each step
<dt-fn>An important error that is well publicized for the face_recognition project is that the model 
is trained on adults is not reliable for images of children. However, fashion144k and fashion550k contains a low percentage of 
images of  children, and this error is likely not significant in this instance. However, face_recognition 
documentation indicates that this error is more prevalent that acceptable at the default tolerance setting of 0.6, 
where children tend to be confused with one another by the model. This is indicative of how the face_recognition 
model handles images not resembling those it was trained on, producing more matches between facial encodings than 
exist. Due to the higher than expected frequency of certain facial encodings matches within fashion550k, I conjecture 
and plan to further investigate whether these encodings differ in some way from those the model was trained on.</dt-fn>.
</p>
<p>
The first cause of error which I will discuss is likely the largest source. The face-classification model I 
employ in this research is trained on the LFWA+ dataset<dt-cite key='liu2015faceattributes'></dt-cite>, 
and the face_recognition project is based on models trained on a dataset of about 3 million 
images<dt-cite key='king2017dlibcplusplus'></dt-cite>, 
many of which were personally gathered by the author. While the model used by face_recognition 
has proven very accurate (99.38% on the 
<a href='http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/'>Labeled Faces in the Wild</a> dataset) 
both the face-classification project and my own additional feature 
selection rely on this model, compounding any errors resulting from using the face_recognition model
on images it was not trained on. Additionally, this error accounts only for identifying a 
match between two faces, not missing an existing face or finding one that does not exist in an image. 
</p>
<p>
In the below graph, the ratios of faces expected:faces located is indicative of the largest error introduced by 
face_recognition and is likely a result of the different training models from this test set. This data was 
generated from a sampling of 100 images from fashion550k which I provided human “metadata” for<dt-fn>In order to provide 
metadata for these images, I individually clicked through and assigned gender and race markers to each image as well as
noting other features from the image such as glasses, hats, or a hairstyle which partially conceals the face. I then 
ran a miniature version of my modified face_classification project on these 100 images which produced a mapping from 
the name of the file to the number of faces found in the image and the race and gender encoding assigned to that face.
I compared the information returned by the modified face_classification to my own collected metadata for each image and
tracked for each race, gender encoding pair a number of factors including correct race and gender identifications, 
incorrectly assigned identifications, missed faces in images, and for each of the previously mentioned other features,
I tracked the frequency that faces with these features were located and correcly identified, and the frequency
with which these faces were missed.</dt-fn>. 
</p>
<img class=l-body src=img/figure_4.png>
<p>
In the above graph, we see the percentage of images with a certain feature which are classified as a certain race and gender 
that are correctly classified. For example, % Correct with Glasses indicates that out of all images which have glasses on the face and 
which are classified as Female and White, 100% are correcly classified. We see that face_classification is very good at correcly 
identifying white female encodings even with distorting features, but misidentifies half of asian female encoding faces with 
distorting features. We also see that more asian female encodings are misidentified as other races, and more encodings of other races
are misidentified as asian and female than white and female.
</p>
<img class=l-body src=img/figure_5.png>
<p>
In this second graph, we see that while a greater percentage of images with white, female encodings are not located by face_recognition,
those images which are missed and contain asian, female encodings are more likely to have distorting features such as glasses
or a turned head. We conclude from these two graphs that both face_recognition and face_classification are unable to compensate 
for distorting accessories or features when identifying images with asian, female encodings present. 
</p>
<img class=l-body src=img/7642292667-7642292667_400.jpg>
<p>
The face in the above image was not located by the libraries I used for facial recognition.
</p>
<img class=l-body src=img/6803143270-6803143270_400.jpg>
<p>
The face in the above image was classified as a white, female encoding by the libraries I used for facial recognition.
</p>
<img class=l-body src=img/6231558987-6231558987_400.jpg>
<p>
The face in the above image was classified as an asian, male encoding by the libraries I used for facial recognition.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The fashion industry is racially biased, and the algorithms used in fashion related machine learning are not improving the situation.
In this article, I used easily accessible facial recognition libraries to determine that the primary public datasets
used in fashion related machine learning research, fashion144k and fashion550k, are racially and gender biased in composition
and model function. Additionally I showed the potential for biased error and specific instances of errors even within the libraries I
used to determine the bias of these datasets. 
</p>
<p>
I look forward to continuing to explore the impact of biased training sets on machine learning research in fashion.
There is a great deal of work remaining in this area. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me at mferguso5512@scrippscollege.edu.
