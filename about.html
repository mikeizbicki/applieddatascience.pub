    <h1>About</h1>
    <p><em>Data Insights</em> is an academic journal for undergraduate data science research.
    Each article presents a single insight that was somehow gleaned from data.
    The editorial focus is on a clear exposition that explains why the insight is important.
    There are no restrictions on the type of data sources used or the methods of analyzing the data,
    but the best insights typically come from simple analyses.
    </p>
    <p>
    
    <!--<em>Data Instights</em> emphasizes clear exposition for a broad audience.-->
    <em>Data Insights</em> was largely inspired by the machine learning journal <a href=https://distill.pub><em>Distill</em></a>, 
    but there is no official relationship between the two.

    Submissions are welcome from any undergraduate student, anywhere in the world.<dt-fn>Submissions from recently graduated undergraduates are also welcome as long as the work was primarily completed before graduation.  A typical example would be publishing a small part of a senior thesis.</dt-fn>
