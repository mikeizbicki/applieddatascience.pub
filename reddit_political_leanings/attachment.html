I agree with the text you added/modified. When I open the HTML on my computer I don't see grey borders on the images, but I also didn't see them last time, so hopefully this isn't still an issue. Hopefully everything looks okay!<br></div><div><br></div><div>Best,</div><div>Conrad</div></div><br><div class="gmail_quote"><div dir="ltr" class="gmail_attr">On Thu, Dec 19, 2019 at 11:43 PM Izbicki, Michael &lt;<a href="mailto:Michael.Izbicki@claremontmckenna.edu">Michael.Izbicki@claremontmckenna.edu</a>&gt; wrote:<br></div><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex">Hi Conrad,<br>
<br>
I have a few really minor tweaks for you to make before I put your<br>
writeup online.&nbsp; Specifically, can you:<br>
<br>
1. add the key back into your total posts per month graph<br>
2. remove the gray borders around the graphs<br>
3. make the graphs 1200x900 pixels<br>
<br>
I've also edited your writeup to change some of the html and make it a<br>
bit more concise (attached).&nbsp; I tried to keep all your conclusions the<br>
same (but I added 1 new conclusion sentence about increased post counts<br>
possibly explaining the perception of increased extremism).&nbsp; Please<br>
read this final version over once again and make any last changes.&nbsp; If<br>
there's no changes, it'll go online as-is.<br>
<br>
