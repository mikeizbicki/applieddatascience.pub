<h1>Reddit's leftward political bias</h1>
<p>
<strong>tl;dr</strong>
I combined data from the reddit API and AllSides Media to measure the political bias of six popular political subreddits.
I found that the supposedly neutral r/politics is significantly more left-leaning than the explicitly left-leaning subreddits r/democrats and r/liberal,
but that political bias has not been increasing over time.

<!--
I used Python scripts and various numerical techniques to analyze the posts on six political subreddits over the past 12 years.
I conclude there is no evidence for increasing political polarization from these subreddits, r/politics is a strongly left-leaning subreddit, 
and political posts dramatically increase near election time.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<!--
<p>
The political climate in the United States has shifted dramatically in the 21st century.
Members on both sides of the political spectrum claim that U.S. politics are becoming increasingly polarized.
In the era of fake news and media bias, it is more important now than ever to examine the actual data.
</p>
-->
<p>
The general sentiment is that political discussion has become increasingly polarized in recent years,
especially on social media sites like reddit.
To test this hypothesis, 
I examined 6 popular political subreddits
(<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/>r/politics</a>,
<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/ >r/worldpolitics</a>,
<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/ >r/democrats</a>,
<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/liberal/ >r/liberal</a>,
<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/republican/ >r/republican</a>,
and
<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/conservative/ >r/conservative</a>)<dt-fn>I used the data dumps available at <a href='https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/'>https://files.pushshift.io/reddit</a>.</dt-fn>.
I looked for trends in the number of posts per month and measured the bias of posts using data from AllSides media.
</p>

<!--
From general media sentiment of late it's tempting to conclude that people on either end of the political spectrum are becoming more extreme in their views.
<a href='https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/'>All Reddit data</a> is readily accessible online thanks to <a href='https://pushshift.io/'>pushshift.io</a>,
so the goal of this project was to write a Python program to automatically analyze aspects of the following six major political subreddits:
<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/>r/politics</a>,
<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/ >r/worldpolitics</a>,
<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/ >r/democrats</a>,
<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/liberal/ >r/liberal</a>,
<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/republican/ >r/republican</a>,
and
<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/conservative/ >r/conservative</a>.
</p>

<h2> Trends in Posting Activity </h2>
<p>
This first plot shows the total number of posts each month for the six subreddits.<dt-fn>Reddit was founded in 2005, but the first political subreddit r/politics was created in August 2007.  
    Therefore, the plot begins at this date.
</dt-fn>
The subreddits are stacked based on founding date, with the youngest subreddits on the bottom. 
</p>


<img class=l-body src=NumberPosts.PNG>
<p>
Large spikes in the graph correspond to the US presidential elections of 2008, 2012, and 2016.
There was relatively little political posting in the non-election timeperiods before President Trump was elected;
but since his election,
political posting has remained high.
</p>
<!--
<p>
The posts per month plot shows how r/politics was the first of the subreddits examined, and it remains dominant in post contributions after the creation of the other five subreddits.
The large spikes on the graph typically correspond to the October of election years (2008, 2012, 2016), as politically active redditors increasingly post leading up to the November elections.
The relative contribution of the smaller subreddits dramatically increases in these pre-election times. 
r/conservative contributions begin to climb after Obama begins his second presidential term in January of 2012. 
A big spike in March of 2016 corresponds to the Iowa caucuses and reflects the heated presidential race at the time.
After Donald Trump is elected in November of 2016, r/worldpolitics experienced dramatic increases in numbers of posts, perhaps due to Trump's aggressive foreign policy strategies.

<h2>Bias in Subreddits</h2>
<p>
To measure the political bias of subreddits,
I used the <a href='https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-ratings'>AllSides media bias ratings</a>. 
This dataset labels domains on a scale from "strongly left" to "strongly right" leaning.
I converted these labels into numbers using the following conversion table:
</p>
<table width=50% style='width:30%;'>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>bias label</strong></td>
        <td><strong>political leaning number</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>strongly left</td><td>-2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>left</td><td>-1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>neutral</td><td>0 </td></tr>
    <tr><td>right</td><td>1 </td></tr>
    <tr><td>strongly right</td><td>2 </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Then for each url in each subreddit, I assigned it the corresponding political leaning number.
</p>
<p>
<!--Then for each For each post to a subreddit,-->
<!--I assigned a "political leaning" number according to the following table:-->
<!--A bias score of -2 represents "strongly left", -1 "left", 0 "neutral", 1 right, 2 for strongly right.-->
The plot below shows a three-month moving average of the political leaning of links in each subreddit.
</p>

<img class=l-body src=PoliticalLeaning.png>

<p>
What stands out most about the political leaning of linked media is how much more left-leaning the media links from r/politics posts are compared to the other subreddits. 
r/politics is often criticized for claiming to accept all political values while actually being a hub for liberal views, and this graph supports such notion.
Leading up to the 2016 election, all non-GOP subreddits generally shifted more conservative, while r/conservative and r/republican became more left-leaning.
This may reflect political parties linking news websites associated with the opposite party, in order to criticize the bias of said party before an election.
</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The political leaning of linked media in the six political subreddits studied has not become more extreme over time. 
In fact, it has historically been less extreme during elections,
and is currently on a moderating trend as we approach the 2020 election season.
</p>
<p>
The frequency of posts, however, has increased dramatically recently.
This may account for the public perception of increased extremism.
</p>

<!--
<p>
I hypothesized that political polarization would be increasing over time, especially since the 2016 presidential election.
However, all the subreddits analyzed do not seem to be following a trend of increasing polarity, at least in terms of the political bias of linked media.
While this analysis only examined a few communities on one website, it may speak to the importance of analyzing data before buying into media claims.
