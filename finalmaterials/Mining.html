<h1>Support for Paying College Athletes Uncorrelated with Political Affiliation or Favorite Sport</h1>
<p>Through twitter data analysis of tweets regarding California's 'Fair Pay to Play Act', we have found 
    that there is no defined relationship between attitude 
    towards the idea of paying college athletes and political affiliation. However, when you look at a 
    state's political affiliation and most popular sport, we can see that Democratic states whose 
    favorite sport is basketball have the most negative attitudes towards the topic.</p>
<dt-byline></dt-byline>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>For this project, we decided to look at the way people in different regions have talked about the idea of college athletes getting paid.  
    Earlier in November, California governor Gavin Newsom approved a bill titled the 'Fair Pay to Play Act' <dt-cite key="nancyskinner"></dt-cite> 
    that would allow college athletes to benefit from their 
    "name, likeness, and image." This is very controversial as it monetizes college athletics.<dt-cite key="usatoday"></dt-cite>  
    Certain states in the US are known to be 'Republican' or 'Democratic' based on their political affiliation. 
    We want to investigate how Twitter users have talked about college athletes getting paid compared to where they live and see 
    if there is a relationship between political lean and opinion about college athletes being compensated.</p>

    <h2>The Data</h2>
<p>In order to get our dataset of tweets about this topic, we filtered through about 3 billion tweets that have been sent out from October 
    2017 to November 2019 using keywords and phrases related to the topic of paying college athletes such as "paying college athletes" and 
    "college athlete endorsement," with many more keywords and phrases <dt-fn>['ncaa paying','college athlete paid','athlete compensation','pay athlete','paying athlete',
        'paying players','pay players','college endorsement','benefit from their name',
        'athletic sponsorship','pay student athletes','pay student-athletes','paying student athletes',
        ,'paying student-athletes','student athlete market','student-athlete market','college athlete endorsement',
        'ncaa endorsement','ncaa pay','paying student athlete','pay student-athlete','paying student-athlete','pay student athlete','athlete endorsement deal',
        'paying college athletes','paying college athlete','name, likeness, and image', '#payforplay #ncaa', '#ncaa #payforplay',
        'paying collegiate athletes', '#ncaa #paytoplay', '#paytoplay #ncaa','fair pay to play','signs sb206','sign sb206','paid student athlete','paying collegiate athlete', 'college athletes to profit', 'compensation for name and likeness',
        'pay to play bill', 'pay to play act', 'pay-to-play bill', 'pay-to-play act', 'pay for play bill', 'pay for play act', 'pay ncaa athletes',
        'paying ncaa athletes', 'college athletes to hire agents', 'ncaa athletes to hire agents', 'college athletes to hire an agent', 'ncaa athletes to hire an agent',
        'college athletes to be paid', 'college players monetizing']</dt-fn> in various wordings and verbages, resulting in 
    only 11,545 tweets. In order to gather our data from twitter, we created a python script to pull the data from the server, 
    using these keywords. In order to lower our number of needed keywords, and we changed all characters to lowercase in order to 
    generalize the keywords even further.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a tweet with positive sentiment: "really happy that college athletes are going to rightfully profit from their name, image and likeness. that's great"</p>

<p>Here is an example of a tweet with negative sentiment: "pay for college athletes is a bad idea! they're there to learn not make a living! make a living after you learn"</p>

<h2>The Figures</h2>

<p>Our first graph shows how often this issue has been talked about over the last few years.  You can see that the frequency of this topic 
    has increased over time with a large spike in October of 2019, the month when Gavin Newsom approved the California bill.  There are also 
    bumps around March of 2018 and 2019, most likely because of March Madness, the NCAA Men's College Basketball Tournament that likely spurred 
    conversation about paying athletes because many NCAA basketball players COULD go into the NBA before they graduate and start making money. Many 
  enter too early.<dt-cite key="basketball"></dt-cite> </p>

<p>This next graph shows WHERE the tweets were sent out across the United States. From this graph, you can see that tweets about this 
  topic are fairly spread out across the United States, with clumps around major US cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City.
  Negative tweets (a polarity less than 0) are red, neutral tweets (a polarity of 0) are green, and positive tweets (a polarity greater than 0) are blue.
  There is some slight overlay, making it appear that neutral tweets are the most prevalent. However, there were about the same 
  number of negative tweets as there were neutral and positive tweets combined.</p>

<img src = "polarity by location.jpg",height=500, width=800 style="margin: 35px 210px 50px;">

<p>This graph shows the average polarity across the years regarding tweets about the issue.  
  As you can see, on average, people feel more negatively about the topic overall, as the highest 
  point on this graph is a polarity of about -0.05.  However, there is an upward trend which shows 
  that people may be warming up to the idea of paying college athletes afterall.  The drop in the 
  graph around November could show that when the idea is actually brought up in a governmental sense, 
  which is what happened when Newsom approved the California bill, people have changed their minds 
  when it becomes a real possibility for college athletes to get paid.</p>

<img src = "pol over time.jpg", height = 500, width = 800 style="margin: 35px 210px 50px;">

<p>This graph shows political affiliation (based on where the tweet was sent from) compared to the polarity 
  of the tweet.  We defined political affiliation as the number of Democratic House Representatives in that state 
  compared to the number of Republican House Representatives in that state<dt-fn>From this website: 
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_members_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives , we got the 
  number of Democratic representatives and divided that by the total number of representatives for that state. this 
  was done using the chrome add-on SelectorGadget and manipulation of that data in R</dt-fn>.  
  An affiliation greater than 0.75 
  indicates a Democratic state, a affiliation between 0.5 and 0.75 indicates a Democratic-leaning state, an 
  affiliation between 0.25 and 0.5 indicates a Republican-leaning state, and an affiliation 
  less than 0.25 indicates a Republican state.  We can see that all four boxplots are nearly identical, 
  but Republican and Republican-Leaning states have a slightly less negative attitude toward our topic.  
  This may be hinting to us that political 
  affiliation does not have a strong relationship with attitude towards college athletes getting paid.  If we 
  were to take this slight difference and run with it, though, we could make sense of this result.  
  Democratic people may be more likely to oppose paying college athletes because many see it as 
  unfair and an immoral monetization of college sports.<dt-cite key="kentucky"></dt-cite>

<p>
    Since there was no true relation between attitude towards the topic and our definition of 
    political lean, we decided to look at whether states who value certain sports are more supportive 
    of the topic.  From a website called FanBuzz<dt-cite key="fanbuzz"></dt-cite>, we were 
    able to find the most popular sport in each state<dt-fn>Unfortunately, we were unable to determine 
    just how the data for the most popular sport was collected.  The group that provided this information for FanBuzz 
    has an Instagram that is filled with maps 
    telling the reader about random statistics about that place with no sources cited.</dt-fn>.  Using this classfication, we can see in these 
    boxplots that states whose most popular sport is basketball have a slightly more negative attitude 
    towards college athletes getting paid.

</p>

<img src = "sportpol.jpg" ,height = 500, width = 800 style="margin: 35px 210px 50px;">

<p>
  To look closer at this data, we split each sport into the possible political affiliations, leaving us with 12 groups: 3 sports * 4 affiliations. 
  <dt-fn>Democratic Basketball, Democratic-Leaning Basketball, Republican-Leaning Basketball, Republican Basketball, 
    Democratic Football, Democratic-Leaning Football, Republican-Leaning Football, Republican Football, 
    Democratic Baseball, Democratic-Leaning Baseball, Republican-Leaning Baseball, Republican Baseball</dt-fn> <dt-fn>Basketball states are in 
      black, Football states are in dark blue, and Baseball states are in light blue
    </dt-fn>With this, we can see
    that for each sport, Republican states have the least negative attitude towards paying college athletes, and Democratic
    states have the most negative.

<h2>Initial Models<dt-fn>In order to train our models, we used the caret package in R</dt-fn></h2>

<p>In our initial model<dt-fn>For the models, we used a data partition. We used a 60% partition for both of our regressions. 
  This resulted in our dataset for our mode; being 4310 tweets.</dt-fn>, we started by 
  analyzing the relationship between the polarity of each tweet, the 
  dependent variable, with regards to paying student athletes, and the political leanings of the state where the 
  tweet originated, the independent variable. As you can see from the figure, there is almost not correlation 
  between these variables. Based off of the regression, we can loosely say the more democratic a state is, the 
  less they agree with paying student athletes. This model only explains .72% of the variability in the data<dt-fn>We first 
    used a single regression model, using the ratio of democratic to republican representatives per each individual state. 
    1 being all democratic, and 0 being all republican. We had an R-squared of about .0072 depending on the random dataset 
    we used to train with.</dt-fn>. 
  We also calculated an root mean squared error of .3734[7], meaning most of the actual values fall within +/- .3734 of 
  the predicted values. This model is awful at predicting someone's opinion of paying college athletes. This is a 
  scatter plot of the data set and the predicted line:</p>

<img src = "predline.jpg", height = 600, width = 800 style="margin: 35px 210px 50px;">

<p>This was the best result we obtained through a single simple regression model. We then used the caret package to 
  create a residual graph in order to see if a linear model was the correct regression method for our data. This graph has 
  the difference between the actual and predicted value on the y-axis and the predicted value on the x-axis. Based off of 
  our graph we can see that choosing a linear regression was the correct methodology because of the 
  randomly distrubuted points.<dt-fn>This graph is clustered at certain predicted value positions because our independent 
    variable was based off of states, so there is only 48 possible options for it.</dt-fn></p>

<img src = "dog.jpg",height = 600, width = 800 style="margin: 35px 210px 50px;">

<p>Since our first model preformed so poorly, we decided to run another simple linear regressing, but we added more 
  dimensions with the goal of decreasing our error. We were able to accomplish that goal. First, we saw a somewhat large 
  increase in our R-squared value, increasing to 1.71%<dt-fn>We added the longitude, latitude, which political party each stated favored, 
    and the favored sport in the state where each tweet originated from. We then ran a multiple regression model, adding the tweets longitude 
    and latitude ­­We had an R-squared of about .0171 depending on the random dataset we used to train.</dt-fn>. This shows us that our 
    independent variables are awful predictors, but 
  that increasing our number of dimensions improved our ability to predict. Secondly, we saw a small decrease in error, decreasing 
  to 0.3731<dt-fn>After each of the regressions, we tested the accuracy of the models on the validation set. We did this by running the model on 
    the independent variable of the validation dataset to predict the polarity of 2872 tweets. I then calculated the Root Mean Squared Error by 
    using the function postResample() that is in the caret package.</dt-fn>. Even though it is a slight decrease, we were able to accomplish our 
    goal of decreasing our error by 
  increasing our dimensions. 
  </p>

<h2>Improving Our Model</h2>

<p>In the models above, we only used a simple linear model. Because we know that a basic linear model weighs every predictive value equally, we 
  know that we can improve our current model. We tested three different model types. First, we tried using a bridge regression, which lessens the 
  volatility of the coefficients, by weighing them towards zero, with the end goal of lowering our error. Next we used a Ridge 
  regression<dt-fn>Lambda was .1 for the ridge­ regression</dt-fn>, which tries to minimize the error by adding bias to the estimates. Lastly, we used a Lasso, which removes irrelevant predictive values. We 
  ran our dataset on the three additional models, and we compared their results to see which was the most effective<dt-fn>To compare results of 
    the bridge, ridge and lasso models, we used the results of the models to predict our validation dataset. We then compared their root mean 
    squared error, and R-Squared values from using the postResample() function.</dt-fn>. Below are the results 
  of each of the models on the validation dataset.</p>
